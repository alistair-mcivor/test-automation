# test-automation
Principles and approaches

- Picking the right things to automate.
- Implementing automation in a way that is reliable and easy to maintain.

More tests at integration level (ie bypassing the UI) and fewer at the UI level where E2E tests are done. Remember UI tests can be slow to run and hard to maintain if the UI changes often.

**The ‘building blocks’ of a UI test automation framework:**

- Package manager
- Test runner
- UI driver
- Assertion library

**The Page Object model - arguments for and against:**

**Cucumber integration - for and against**
